- Terminal Access to the selected Pi via local keyboard or another remote protocol (e.g., PuTTY, Windows PowerShell).
- If you do not use the recommended USB conversion board (See the Recommended Hardware list), several small jumper wires.
- Basic Linux Knowledge or knowledge of where to find resources through the Internet.

You need a Raspberry Pi and one hotspot board in DVRS mode, or two hotspots and either two Raspberry Pis, one Pi and one USB board, or any Linux host and two USB boards to use the system.  USB boards are recommended as the better way to flash new firmware on your board.
